# SimpleLattice

a small blender 2.8 addon to make working with lattices simpler.

Basically just select objects/vertices and run>SimpleLattice. This will add a lattice object, creates modifiers and vertex groups. 
You can choose the alignment of the lattice, the number of control points and the interplation type.

It also does auto cleanup in the back, but only on modifiers & vertex groups with "SimpleLattice" in the name.
